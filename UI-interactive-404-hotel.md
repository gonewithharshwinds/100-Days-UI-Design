Given the hotel business is more of client service based business, a standard 404 error page can be frustrating and discouraging for users. By incorporating interactivity, you transform a negative experience into a positive one. Engaging users with interactive elements, visuals, and surprises helps retain their interest and encourages them to continue exploring the website. 

Rather than leaving frustrated visitors to abandon the website, an interactive 404 page holds their attention and redirects them towards relevant content or alternative options. This can reduce bounce rates and potentially convert a lost user into a converted lead or customer.
